## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce
- 1/2 cup low-sodium vegetable stock, or water
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1/2 Tablespoon rice vinegar
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 – 2 teaspoon grated ginger
- 1 Tablespoon sugar or honey*, up to 2 tablespoons for a more sweet than sour sauce
- 1 Tablespoon cornstarch
- Pinch red pepper flakes, optional

## Directions

1. In a bowl or mason jar with a lid, combine all of the ingredients and whisk or shake well until combined.
1. Use immediately in a stir fry recipe, simmering it to thicken. Or store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week before using. This recipe yields approximately 1 ¼ cup of sauce; you may want to start using half in your recipe and add more as desired. Enjoy!
