# Corn Chipotle Ravioli Lasagna

## Ingredients

- 3 tbsp butter
- 1/2 cup thinly slice onions
- 2 cups fresh corn kernels (from about 2 ears) or frozen corn, thawed
- 1 tsp chopped fresh thyme
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp chopped canned chipotle chiles in adobo
- 1 tbsp adobo sauce from can of chipotle
- 1 large zucchini, thinly sliced into rounds
- 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 cups milk
- Salt and pepper
- 22-ounce package frozen cheese ravioli, thawed
- 1 cup pepper jack cheese, shredded
- 1 cup colby jack cheese, shredded

## Directions

1. Melt the butter in a medium heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and saute until translucent, 5 minutes. Add the corn and saute for another 5 minutes. Add the thyme and garlic and saute until fragrant, 1 minute. Add in the chipotle chiles and zucchini and cook over medium-low heat until the flavors incorporate, 5 minutes. Stir in the flour. Add the milk and bring just to a simmer; stir in the adobo sauce. Season with salt and pepper and remove from heat.
1. Preheat the broiler to high.
1. For assembling the lasagna: Spread about one-quarter of the zucchini-corn mixture over the bottom of a large gratin or 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Top with the ravioli in an even layer. Pour over the remaining zucchini-corn mixture. Top with the cheese.
1. Broil until the top is browned and bubbly, about 8 minutes.
