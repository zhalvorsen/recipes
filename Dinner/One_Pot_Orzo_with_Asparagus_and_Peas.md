## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 medium red onion
- 2 garlic cloves, sliced
- ¾ lb (350 g) asparagus, trimmed and cut into bite-size pieces
- 1 1/2 cups (225 g) orzo
- 1 cup (150 g) frozen or fresh peas
- 3 1/2 cups (850 ml) vegetable stock
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1/2 lemon, juice and zest
- 1/3 cup (30 g) Parmesan, grated

## Directions

1. Melt the butter in a skillet or pot over medium heat and saute the red onion for 2-3 minutes until softened. Add the garlic and continue to cook for another minute until fragrant.
1. Next, add the asparagus to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally. This will infuse it with butter flavor and soften it a bit.
1. Stir in the orzo, toast it for a minute, then add the peas and vegetable stock.
1. Bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes or until the orzo is al dente. Stir from time to time to prevent the orzo from sticking to the bottom of the pot.
1. Add the salt, ground black pepper, lemon zest and juice and stir to combine.
1. Finish with the Parmesan and serve immediately, with some extra freshly grated Parmesan on top if you like.
