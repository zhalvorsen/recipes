## Ingredients

1 tbspextra virgin olive oil
1 shallot, chopped
4-6 clovegarlic, smashed
red pepper flakes
2 tbspsalted butter
2 cupdry orzo pasta
6 cuplow sodium chicken or vegetable broth
1 canwhite beans
kosher salt and black pepper
1/2 bunchkale, finely shredded
1/2 cupbasil pesto
1/2 cupwhole milk or canned full fat coconut milk
1 cupgrated parmesan cheese
zest and juice of 1 lemon

## Directions

1. Heat the olive oil in a large dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the shallot, garlic, and chili flakes and cook until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Drop in the butter, then stir in the orzo. Cook until golden, 1-3 minutes. Pour in the broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the beans and kale. Season with salt and pepper. If you have one, add a parmesan rind. Simmer 8-10 minutes until the orzo is al dente, stirring often. It should become very creamy.
1. Stir in the pesto, milk, parmesan, and lemon, cook another few minutes until warmed through.
1. Divide the orzo and broth among bowls and add additional parmesan and black pepper. I like to add some fresh dill, parsley, or basil too!
