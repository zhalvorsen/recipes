## Ingredients

- 4 Medium sweet potatoes, chopped into bite-sized cubes
- 1 Small onion, chopped
- 2-3 Bell peppers, chopped
- 3 cups Riced cauliflower
- 2 Medium zucchini, chopped
- 4 Frozen garlic cubes, or minced cloves
- 10-oz can Rotel, or canned tomatoes, drained
- 4-oz can Green chilis, drained
- 1/4 cup Reduced-fat cream cheese
- 1 Tbsp Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, minced or blended if whole*
- 2 Tbsp Cumin
- 2 Tbsp Chili powder
- 1.5 Tbsp Garlic powder
- 1.5 Tbsp Kosher salt
- 1 Tbsp Dried oregano
- 1 Tbsp Paprika
- 6 cups Rotisserie or Cooked chicken breast, chopped or shredded
- 1 cup Cilantro, chopped

## Directions

1. Heat a LARGE, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium high heat with a spritz of olive oil. Add sweet potatoes and cook covered, stirring often for about 10 minutes to soften. Add onion, bell pepper, and cauliflower rice (throw in a pinch of kosher salt to help veggies release their water) and cook for another 10-15 minutes until the veggies are fragrant and cauliflower is pretty tender.
1. Add chopped zucchini, and garlic. Cover and cook for another 5 minutes stirring often, until everything is tender to your liking. Add drained rotel, green chilis, cream cheese, chipotle peppers, and spices. Combine well until the cream cheese is melted, then mix in your cooked chicken and fresh cilantro! Do it carefully since your pan will be FULL.*
1. For the cheese lovers in our family, we like to top half with cheese and broil for a minute to melt!
1. Finish with a drizzle of the enchilada sauce, some fresh cilantro leaves or chopped green onion and serve immediately. You can eat it straight like a casserole, or over greens, or rice, or piled into tortillas or alongside tortilla chips! We love to add some fresh avocado and either some sour cream or one of my favorite green sauces. (This dairy-free green sauce, this jalapeño avocado dressing, or this green goddess dressing.) So good!
