## Ingredients

### Cuban Black Beans

- 1 lb. dried black beans, rinsed and pick over to remove odd beans
- 1 spanish onion, diced
- 5 – 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 green bell peppers, cored and diced
- 1 jalapeno, seeds removed and diced (optional)
- ½ cup pitted green olives, drained and sliced (I used a 6oz jar)
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1 teaspoon oregano
- 2 bay leaves
- 4 cups water or vegetable broth (or combo)
- 1 – 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar (distilled or white wine vinegar is great too)
- mineral salt & cracked pepper, to taste

### Quinoa

- 1 cup dried quinoa
- 1 3/4 cup water
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- Dash of salt

### Toppings

- Mango Salsa
- Lime wedges

## Directions

1. Add all the ingredients for the cuban black beans, except the vinegar, to the bowl of the Instant Pot and give a good stir. Position lid to lock, and turn the vent valve at the top to its SEALED position.
1. Press the BEANS/CHILI button, and adjust the mode to NORMAL for soft, tender beans, or MORE for very soft, almost mushy beans. Alternately, press MANUAL, then HIGH PRESSURE and set timer for 30 minutes for soft beans, or 35 minutes for very soft beans. When timer goes off, let pressure release naturally for at least 25 minutes. Carefully turn vent valve to open, let remaining pressure release and remove lid.
1. Add the 2 tablespoons of vinegar (this step will brighten the overall flavor and I highly recommend not skipping this step). Season with salt & pepper to taste. Beans will soak up the remaining liquids as they cool. Remove bay leaves before serving.
