## Ingredients

### Stir fry

- 2 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil
- 1 1/2 pounds chicken breasts or thighs chopped into 1-inch pieces
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 4 tablespoons red curry paste
- 1 red bell pepper chopped into 1” pieces
- 1 green bell pepper chopped into 1” pieces
- 1 zucchini sliced into half moons
- 1 mango cubed (for garnish)
- 1-3 teaspoons Asian chili sauce

### Blender Mango Sauce

- 1 13.5 oz can coconut milk I like Chaokoh
- 2 cups roughly chopped mango about 2 mangos (may sub frozen or jarred)
- 1/2 large yellow onion roughly chopped
- 1-inch ginger, peeled roughly chopped
- 4 cloves garlic peeled
- 3 tablespoons lime juice
- 2 tablespoons less sodium soy sauce
- 2 tablespoon fish sauce
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar more or less to taste
- 1 teaspoon dried basil

### Add later

- 1/4 cup loosely packed fresh Thai basil, chopped optional

## Directions

1. Add all of the Blender Mango Sauce ingredients to your blender and blend until smooth. Set aside.
1. While the chicken is still on the cutting board, pat it dry then season with ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper.
1. Heat oil over medium high heat in large skillet (stainless-steel or cast iron) until very hot. Add chicken and red curry paste and cook just until most pieces are no longer pink (they will finish cooking in the sauce). Add bell peppers and continue to cook for 2 minutes.
1. Stir in Mango Sauce followed by zucchini. Simmer for 5 minutes; add chili sauce to taste.. Stir in fresh Thai basil if using then remove from heat.
1. Taste and season with additional salt to taste and/or brown sugar for sweeter, chili sauce for spicier or lime for tangier (this is important because some mangos are sweeter than others). Garnish with remaining 1 cup chopped mangos, and optional fresh basil, cilantro and chili sauce to taste. Serve with rice, zoodles, etc.
