## Ingredients

- 2 pounds chicken breasts (thawed)*
- 1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1/4 cup water
- sriracha to taste (optional)

## Sweet Chili Sesame Sauce

- 2-4 tablespoons Asian sweet chili sauce (I use Mae Ploy)**
- 1/3 cup low sodium soy sauce
- 1/3 cup ketchup
- 1/3 cup packed brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons quality hoisin sauce (like Lee Kum Kee or Kikkkoman)***
- 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
- 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder or 3-4 garlic cloves minced
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/2 teaspoon ginger powder or 2 teaspoons freshly grated ginger
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper

## Directions

1. Add chicken to the bottom of your crockpot.
1. Whisk the Sweet Chili Sesame Sauce ingredients together in a medium bowl. Pour over chicken.
1. Cook on low for 5-7 hours or on high for 3-4 hours OR until the chicken is tender enough to shred.
1. Shred chicken in the crockpot and add 1 ½ tablespoons cornstarch mixed with ¼ cup water to the crockpot. Stir contents around. Cook on high for 20-30 minutes until sauce thickens. Taste and add Sriracha for spicier, brown sugar for sweeter if desired. *Alternatively, you can add the cornstarch slurry and liquid from the crockpot to a saucepan and simmer until thickened on the stove - this will create a thicker sauce.*
1. Serve with rice and garnish with sesame seeds and green onions.
