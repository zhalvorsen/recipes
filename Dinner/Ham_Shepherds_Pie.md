## Ingredients

### Potato topping

- 1 1/2 (2 large) russet potatoes, peeled and diced
- 1/4 cup whole milk
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 3/4 cup sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
- 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, ground
- 1 egg, yolk only

### Ham filling

- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 (14 ounce) package Hafield Ham Steak, diced
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, ground
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme, chopped
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 pound frozen peas and carrots

## Directions

### For the potato topping

1. Meanwhile, cover the potatoes in a pot with cold water by 2 inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, and cook until tender (a fork goes in with ease), 15 to 20 minutes; drain and transfer to a bowl.
2. To the bowl, add milk and butter and mash until smooth and the butter has melted. Stir in the cheese, salt, and pepper until the cheese has melted; taste and season with more salt and pepper, if needed. Lastly, stir in the egg yolk.

### For assembly

1. Heat the oven to 400ËšF.
2. You can either keep the ham filling in an oven-safe skillet or transfer to a baking dish. Spread the potato topping evenly over the top. (Optional: Create a design with a fork or other utensil.)
3. Place the baking dish on a rimmed baking sheet to catch any potential spillover and bake until bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes. Broil until nicely browned on top, 1 to 2 minutes. Let cool slightly before serving.
