## Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp. virgin coconut oil
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1 1" piece peeled ginger, finely chopped
- 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more
- 1/4 cup Thai green curry paste
- 1 medium sweet potato, peeled, cut into ½" cubes
- 3/4 cup brown or green lentils
- 4 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth
- 1 13.5-oz. can unsweetened coconut milk, shaken well
- 4 cups (loosely packed) baby spinach leaves
- 1/2 tsp. (or more) fish sauce
- Small handful cilantro leaves with tender stems and lime wedges (for serving)

## Directions

1. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium. Add onion, garlic, and ginger; season with salt. Cook, stirring often, until onion is translucent and starts to soften, about 3 minutes. Add curry paste and cook, stirring and scraping bottom of pan constantly, until paste is fragrant and slightly darkened and mixture starts to stick to pan, about 3 minutes.
1. Stir sweet potato and lentils into onion mixture, then add broth and 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook soup, stirring occasionally, until sweet potatoes are cooked through and lentils are tender but not mushy, 20–25 minutes.
1. Add coconut milk to soup; return to a simmer. Add spinach and fish sauce and cook just until spinach is wilted, about 30 seconds. Taste soup and season with more salt and/or fish sauce if needed.
1. Ladle soup into bowls and top with cilantro. Serve with lime wedges.
