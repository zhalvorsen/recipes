## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup diced yellow onion
- 1 clove of garlic, grated or minced
- 1/2 cup uncooked long grain brown rice
- 1/2 cup dry green lentils, rinsed
- 3 cups low sodium vegetable broth
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/4 teaspoon ground chipotle powder or smoked paprika
- Kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste
- 15 ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1/2 cup fire roasted tomatoes, drained
- 4 ounce can diced green chiles
- 1 small zucchini, shredded
- 1/2 cup defrosted frozen corn
- 1 cup red enchilada sauce
- 1 cup shredded cheese, colby jack, cheddar, or monterey jack
- Cilantro for garnish (optional)

## Directions

1. Heat a large skillet (with a lid) or pot over medium-high heat. When the pot is heated add in a little olive oil and stir in the onion and garlic. Season with salt and sauté for 2-3 minutes then add in the brown rice and lentils.
1. Pour in the vegetable broth. Stir and bring to a boil. Once boiling, cover and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 35-45 minutes, or until the lentils and rice are tender. If there's any excess liquid drain it.
1. Add the dried spices, salt and pepper, to the rice and lentils. Stir in the remaining ingredients, except a 1/2 cup of the cheese.
1. Heat the mixture until the cheese is melted. Top with the remaining cheese and cover with a lid. Heat on low until the cheese is melted and the mixture is bubbly. Garnish with cilantro and serve.
