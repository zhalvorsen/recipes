## Ingredients

- 1 can lite coconut milk
- 4 cups chicken broth, divided
- 3 large carrots, sliced
- 1 pound chicken tenderloins, cubed (see note)
- juice of 2 limes
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon Thai green curry paste (2 if you like it spicy)
- 1/2 teaspoon yellow curry powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 6 ounces whole wheat spaghetti pasta (or any pasta with box direction cook time of 6-7 minutes), broken in half
- 1 green bell pepper, sliced into long strips
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced into long strips
- 1 yellow bell pepper, sliced into long strips
- 1 bunch cilantro, chopped
- 4 green onions, chopped
- For serving: lime wedges, soy sauce, roasted peanuts, Sriracha

## Directions

1. Add coconut milk, 2 cups chicken broth, carrots, chicken, lime juice, soy sauce, curry paste, curry powder, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and pasta, stir.  Note:  Make sure pasta is scattered a bit instead of sitting together in a clump.  This will help it not to stick together when itâ€™s cooking.  
1. Add sliced bell peppers on top, do not stir.  Secure the lid and turn pressure release knob to a sealed position. Cook at high pressure for 2 minutes.
1. When cooking is complete, let pressure release naturally for 2 minutes, then use a quick release.  If liquid sprays from valve, turn valve back to a sealed position and wait another 5 minutes before opening again.
1. Stir in cilantro, and green onions.
1. Add the remaining 2 cups of chicken broth if desired for a thinner soup.
1. Serve in a bowl with an extra squeeze of lime juice and/or soy sauce, roasted peanuts, and a few dots of Sriracha.

### Notes

- We don't usually use chicken.
- We usually use brown rice noodles.
- We usually add green beans and occasionally squash.
