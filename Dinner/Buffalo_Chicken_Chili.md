## Ingredients

### Chili

- 1 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 large yellow onion diced
- 2 stalks celery diced
- 5 cloves garlic minced
- 1 1/2 lbs. boneless skinless chicken breasts each breast cut into about 3 pieces
- 15 oz can great northern beans drained and rinsed
- 28 oz can fire-roasted diced tomatoes UNdrained
- 4 oz can diced green chiles drained
- 2 cups reduced sodium chicken broth
- 1/2 cup buffalo wing sauce I use Frank's Red Hot wing sauce
- 3 tsp chili powder
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 4 oz cream cheese softened and cubed
- 1/2 cup sour cream or plain Greek yogurt

### Garnishes (optional but recommended for the best flavor)

- dollop of sour cream
- drizzle of buffalo wing sauce
- minced celery
- minced green onions
- blue cheese crumbles
- sprinkle of black pepper

## Directions

1. Cook aromatics
    1. Heat a large dutch oven (I use a 6 quart) over MED heat. Once hot, add the olive oil and butter, then the onion and celery.
    1. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until softened. Add garlic and cook about 30 more seconds.
1. Make chili
    1. Add the chicken breast pieces to the pot, then top with the beans, diced tomatoes, green chiles, chicken broth, buffalo wing sauce, chili powder, cumin, oregano, salt, and pepper.
    1. Stir well, then bring to a low boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to MED LOW and simmer uncovered about 20-25 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes or so to make sure nothing is sticking to the bottom of the pot.
1. Shred chicken
    1. Use tongs to remove chicken pieces to a bowl, plate, or cutting board. Use two forks to shred the chicken, and set aside for a bit.
1. Add dairy
    1. Add the cream cheese to a small mixing bowl. Use a ladle to add a few ladlefuls of the broth to the mixing bowl, and whisk until smooth. Stir in sour cream.
    1. Pour cream cheese/sour cream mixture to the dutch oven and return the shredded chicken to the pot, and stir well to combine.
1. Serve
    1. Serve hot, with desired garnishes.
