1. Taste the sauce. The goal is to reach a balance of sweet, sour, spicy, and salty. Add more sugar if you find the sauce too sour (this will depend on the sweetness of your mangoes). If not spicy enough, add more chile. If not salty/flavorful enough, add more fish sauce. If too salty or too sweet, add more lime juice. Set aside.
