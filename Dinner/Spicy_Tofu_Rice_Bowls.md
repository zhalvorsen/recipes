## Ingredients

### Tofu

- 14 ounce block extra firm tofu
- olive oil
- 2 tablespoons sriracha
- 2 tablespoons coconut aminos (or reduced sodium soy sauce or tamari)
- 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- kosher salt to taste (omit if using tamari or soy sauce)

### Cucumber Salad

- 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons coconut aminos (or reduced sodium soy sauce or tamari)
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1⁄4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 english cucumber, halved and thinly sliced
- 3 green onions, finely chopped
- 1⁄2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- 2 cups thinly sliced cabbage

### Cilantro Sauce

- 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1⁄2 jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped
- 1 garlic clove
- 1⁄2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- juice of 1/2 lime (about 1 1/2 tablespoons)
- kosher salt, to taste

## Directions

- Press the tofu: Wrap the tofu block in a clean kitchen towel or paper towels and place a heavy object (heavy bottom pan or pot) on top for 20 to 30 minutes, or use a tofu press.
- Preheat the oven to 400F.
- Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Once boiling, add the rice, stir, cover, and cook until fluffy and all the liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes.
- Meanwhile, assemble the Cucumber Salad: Add all of the ingredients to a medium-sized bowl and toss to combine. Cover and chill until serving.
- Prepare the Tofu: Slice the pressed tofu block into 1/2-inch cubes and transfer to a sheet pan lined with parchment and toss with a generous drizzle of olive oil. Bake until crispy, tossing halfway through, about 20 minutes.
- While the tofu bakes, make the spicy sauce: Combine the sriracha, coconut aminos, sesame oil, rice vinegar, maple syrup, and ginger in a small jar. Shake or whisk to combine.
- Add the baked tofu and half of the sauce to a medium-sized bowl. Toss to coat. Add more sauce as desired, or reserve the remaining sauce for serving.
- Add all of the cilantro sauce ingredients to a food processor or blender and pulse until the cilantro is very finely chopped and no large pieces remain.
- To assemble the bowls divide the rice, cucumber salad, and spicy tofu among 4 bowls. Top with the cilantro sauce, and reserved spicy sauce if desired.
