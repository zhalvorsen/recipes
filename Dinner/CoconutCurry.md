# Coconut Curry

## Ingredients
- 1 cup brown rice
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 cup broccoli (or use green beans)
- 1 spring onions
- 1 sweet potato
- 2 carrot
- 1/2 zucchini
- 2 sticks lemongrass
- 2 tsp curry powder
- 1 tbsp yellow curry paste (or red for hotter, green for hottest!)
- 1 can coconut milk
- 1 can chickpeas (15 oz = 435g, drained and rinsed)
- 1 tbsp maple syrup
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 lemon (juiced; lime works too!)
- Roasted Cashews

## Directions
1. If serving with rice, get that cooking now according to package instructions.
1. Grate the sweet potato and the carrots.
1. Chop the spring onion, broccoli, and zucchini.
1. Add the olive oil to a large pan and fry all the veg on a medium heat. This needs about 5-7 minutes.
1. Next, add the curry powder and curry paste, and the beaten (smack it with a heavy spoon a few times to let out the flavour) lemongrass.
1. Drain and rinse the chickpeas.
1. Stir and fry for another couple of minutes then add the coconut milk, chickpeas, lemon juice, maple syrup and salt. Let it simmer for another 5 minutes.
1. Alright, that's it. Take out the lemongrass. Serve with rice and top with roasted cashews or peanuts. Easy. Awesome.
