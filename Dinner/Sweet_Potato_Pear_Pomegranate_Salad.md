## Ingredients

### For the sweet potatoes

- 2 medium sweet potatoes, cut into 1/2 cubes (can also use cubed butternut squash)
- 1 tablespoon melted coconut oil
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar (or coconut sugar or maple syrup)
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- Freshly ground salt and pepper

### For the pecans

- 1/2 cup pecans

### For the salad

- 2 (6 ounce) bags organic spinach (about 8-10 cups spinach)
- 3/4 cup pomegranate seeds, from 1 pomegranate
- 2 medium ripe bartlett pears, thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup goat cheese (or can use feta)

### For the dressing

- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1 teaspoon honey
- 1/2 teaspoon dijon mustard
- Salt and pepper, to taste

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a small bowl, whisk together the coconut oil, brown sugar, minced garlic, cinnamon and cayenne. Place the sweet potatoes on a baking sheet and pour mixture over the top. Season with salt and pepper and toss well to coat. Roast for 20-30 minutes until sweet potatoes are fork-tender, tossing a bit halfway through. They should get a little crispy on the edges.
2. While the sweet potatoes are cooking, you can toast the pecans on the stovetop: Add pecans to a pan and place over medium heat, stirring occasionally for 2-5 minutes until pecans are fragrant and slightly golden brown on edges. Remove from heat and transfer to a cutting board. After a few minutes, chop the pecans into big pieces. Set aside.
3. In a mason jar or small bowl, add all of the dressing ingredients. Shake or mix well to combine. Taste and add additional salt/pepper, if necessary.
4. In a large bowl, add the spinach, pomegranate seeds, pear slices, and cooked sweet potatoes. Top with toasted pecans and goat cheese crumbles. Drizzle with desired amount of dressing, then toss to coat. Add to bowls and serve with extra pecans and goat cheese, if desired
