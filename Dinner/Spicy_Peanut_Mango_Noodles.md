[Source](https://yestoyolks.com/2019/02/28/quick-easy-spicy-peanut-noodles-with-mango/)

## Ingredients

### Sauce Ingredients

- 1/2 cup fresh mango, cubed
- 1/3 cup creamy peanut butter
- 1/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon honey or brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon chile garlic paste (I like sambal oelek)
- 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
- 4 garlic cloves, minced or pressed
- 1/4 cup warm water

### Noodles Ingredients

- 8 oz rice noodles (or other long pasta of choice)
- 2 teaspoons canola oil
- 1 red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
- 1 cup shredded carrots (you can shred them yourself but I buy the pre-shredded ones from the store to make my life easier)
- 1/2 cup sugar snap peas (I buy them frozen – no need to defrost them here)
- 1 mango, peeled, pitted, and thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup Thai basil, chopped (regular basil works too)
- 1/4 cup cilantro, chopped
- Juice of 1 lime
- 4 scallions, chopped
- 1/2 cup peanuts, chopped

## Directions

### Start

1. Soak the noodles in hot water, according to the package directions. Once tender, drain, rinse, and set aside.
2. Depending on the brand of rice noodle you are using, the recommended soaking time may be anywhere between 15-30 minutes, so I like to do this step first. That way, the noodles are ready and waiting for me when I need them.

### Sauce Directions

1. Combine all the ingredients except the water in a food processor.
2. Pulse to combine, scraping down the sides a couple times, and then run the machine until the mixture is smooth.
3. Stream in the warm water, a tablespoon or so at a time, until the sauce thins out a bit. It should be loose at this point – the starch from the noodles will help thicken it up.
4. Season, to taste, with additional honey, chile paste, or soy sauce (I find that sauces like this are definitely a “to taste” kind of deal. Make it as spicy, sweet, or salty as you prefer).

### Noodle Directions

1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
2. Add the bell pepper, shredded carrots, and snap peas and cook for 2-3 minutes or until they are tender crisp.
3. Add the drained noodles, along with the sauce, and toss to combine everything.
4. Add in the mango, basil, cilantro, lime juice, and scallions and continue tossing and stirring for a couple minutes or until everything is warmed through and evenly coated in the sauce.
5. Serve immediately, garnished with additional herbs, the chopped peanuts, and lime wedges.
