## Ingredients

- 2 cans (28oz - 800 grams) cannellini beans or white beans, drained
- 1 medium-size onion, diced
- 1 celery stalk, diced
- 1 large carrot, diced
- 1-2 garlic cloves, diced or pressed
- 1 cup (7 oz - 200 grams), frozen spinach * (optional)
- 2 medium-size potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
- 1 Tbsp olive oil, plus more for serving
- 1 Tbsp tomato paste
- 1/3 cup (80 ml) white wine
- 1 sprig rosemary (or 1 Tbsp of chopped fresh leaves/1/2 tsp of dried)
- 2 cups (500 ml) vegetable broth or hot water
- 1/2 tsp paprika (optional)
- 1/2 tsp fine salt, plus more to taste
- 1/8 tsp black pepper, plus more to taste

## Directions

1. Warm the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the diced onion, carrot, and celery. Cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened and is turning translucent, about 5 minutes.
2. Add the garlic, beans, tomato paste, potatoes, rosemary (whole sprig, chopped, or dried, whatever it's easier for you) and paprika (if you use it). Cook stirring frequently, about 1 minute.
3. Add the wine, stir well and let it simmer until it has evaporated, cooking for another minute.
4. Then add the frozen spinach, the vegetable broth and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Raise the heat and bring the mixture to a boil, then cover the pot, reduce heat and cook gently for 15 minutes.
5. When the potatoes are soft and the soup is thick and creamy, remove the pot from heat, then remove the sprig rosemary*. Taste and season with salt and pepper. (I usually add a pinch of salt at the beginning + 1/2 tsp later. You might need more salt, depending on your vegetable broth and on your personal preferences.)*
6. Divide into bowls, drizzle with olive oil or extra virgin olive oil, and more freshly ground black pepper if you like. Serve with crusty whole grain bread and, if you don't keep it vegan, add freshly grated parmesan cheese for extra flavor. Enjoy!
