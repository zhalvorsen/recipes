## Ingredients

- 2 cups all purpose flour, spooned and leveled, plus 1 teaspoon for dusting berries
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups low-fat buttermilk
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup fresh blueberries (6 ounces), plus more for serving
- Nonstick cooking spray
- Sweetened creme fraiche and confectioners' sugar, for serving

## Directions

1. Preheat oven and waffle maker; combine dry ingredients:
    1. Preheat oven to 275°F; set a rack on a baking sheet and place in oven. Preheat waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; set aside.
1. Whisk buttermilk, butter, and eggs; add flour mixture:
    1. In a large bowl whisk together buttermilk, butter, and eggs. Add flour mixture to buttermilk mixture and stir just until batter is combined. Toss berries in 1 teaspoon flour; fold into batter.
1. Cook waffles:
    1. Lightly coat waffle iron with cooking spray. Pour 1 cup batter (this may vary depending on size of waffle iron) in the center of iron, spreading evenly with a spatula. Close iron; cook until waffles are golden brown and crisp, 7 to 8 minutes.
1. Transfer to oven to keep warm while remaining waffles cook:
    1. Remove from iron and quickly toss back and forth from hand to hand to cool slightly and allow waffles to crisp up. Transfer to rack in oven; repeat with remaining batter. Serve with blueberries, crème fraîche, and a sprinkle of confectioners' sugar or maple syrup.
