## Ingredients

- 1 (15 oz) can pure pumpkin puree
- 1/2 cup canola oil, or melted coconut oil, use refined if you don’t want it to taste like coconut
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup coconut sugar
- 1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk
- 1/4 cup pure maple syrup
- 2 cups flour (I like to use one cup whole wheat, one cup all purpose)*
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoons ground nutmeg
- 1/2 teaspoons ground cloves
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips

## Directions

1. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F and grease a mini muffin pan.  To a large bowl, add the pumpkin puree, milk, eggs, oil, maple syrup, coconut sugar and vanilla extract.  Use a large whisk to mix batter together well.
1. Next, add in the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and salt.  Use a large spoon, or spatula, to mix the batter well, until it is all mixed together and there are no big lumps.
1. Use a tablespoon scoop, or small spoon, to scoop the batter into the mini muffin pan.  You should get about 48 mini muffins with this recipe.  Bake muffins until firm to the touch and an inserted toothpick comes out clean, about 20 minutes.
1. Remove muffins from the oven and let cool in the pan for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
