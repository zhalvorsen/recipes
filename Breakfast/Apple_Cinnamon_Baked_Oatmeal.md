## Ingredients

- 1 3/4 cup unsweetened vanilla almond or cashew milk , (any milk product can be used)
- 2 large eggs
- 1/3 cup maple syrup
- 1/4 cup butter or coconut oil, melted
- 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, (can sub with mashed banana)
- 3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats, (gluten-free as needed)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon allspice
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 cups finely chopped apple , or 1 small apple (I like Honeycrisp)
- Optional for topping: 1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans
- Optional garnish: whipped topping, ice cream, yogurt, nut/seed butter, drizzle of chocolate, maple syrup, and/or fresh fruit

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spray a 9×9-inch or 11×7-inch (or other similar size) baking pan with nonstick spray. Stir the liquid ingredients (milk, eggs, maple syrup, melted butter and applesauce) together in one large bowl.
1. Add the dry ingredients (oats, baking powder, spices and salt) to the bowl with the wet ingredients and mix until fully combined, then stir in diced apple. Pour the mixture into prepared baking pan. If desired, top with additional apple slices and/or nuts (or stir nuts into the oatmeal, if using).
1. Bake oatmeal for 35 minutes or until the center appears *almost* set, which will give you a soft oatmeal. For drier and more solid baked oatmeal, bake until center has set. Cool for at least 5 minutes before serving. Spoon or slice and serve with yogurt, almond butter or maple syrup, if desired.
