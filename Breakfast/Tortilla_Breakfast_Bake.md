## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms
- 1 small yellow onion, sliced thin
- 1 small green bell pepper, sliced thin
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 cup spinach
- One 12-inch flour tortilla
- 1 cup shredded Colby Jack cheese
- 4 large eggs
- 2 green onions, sliced thin
- Hot sauce, for serving

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
1. Heat the olive oil in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the mushrooms, onions and bell peppers. Cook until slightly charred, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Turn off the heat and stir in the spinach. Remove the veggie mix to a plate.
1. Add the tortilla to the skillet, pressing it lightly to touch the bottom. Top the tortilla with two-thirds of the cheese and the reserved veggie mix. Crack the eggs over the top and cover with the remaining cheese. Sprinkle the yolks with salt and pepper.
1. Bake until the cheese has melted and the whites of the eggs have set, 15 to 17 minutes for a runny yolk, 20 to 22 minutes for a firmer yolk.
1. Transfer the tortilla to a cutting board or platter. Top with the green onions and hot sauce. Slice into wedges and serve.
