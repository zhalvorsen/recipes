## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup pumpkin puree
- 3/4 cup cottage cheese (full-fat or 2%)
- 2 large eggs
- 2 Tbsp. maple syrup
- 1 1/2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
- 2 tsp. baking powder
- 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice
- 1/4 tsp. kosher salt
- Oil or butter for cooking
- Optional add-ins or toppings: Chopped pecans or walnuts, chocolate chips, maple butter, almond butter, and/or maple syrup.

## Directions

1. Add pumpkin puree, cottage cheese, eggs, and maple syrup to a blender. (Adding the wet ingredients first helps lubricate the blade and aid in smoother blending.) Next, add the dry ingredients (oats, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice, and salt).
1. Blend until smooth, starting on low speed and increasing to medium-high. (If you plan on mixing in nuts or chocolate chips, stir them in after blending.) Let batter sit in the blender while you preheat a skillet (or griddle) over medium heat. Grease with oil or butter.
1. Once the pan is hot, add 1/4 cup batter (the batter will be thick) to the pan for each pancake.
1. Use the back of a spoon to smooth out batter to create a rounded pancake. Cook for 2 to 4 minutes, or until pancakes slightly puff up and bubbles form around the edges. Gently flip, and cook another 2 minutes, or until golden brown on the underside. (Note: if the pancakes start browning too quickly, reduce heat to medium-low to prevent burning.)
1. Serve warm with toppings of choice.
