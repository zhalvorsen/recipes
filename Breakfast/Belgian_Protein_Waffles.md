[Source](https://ameessavorydish.com/belgian-protein-waffles/#wprm-recipe-container-15761)

## Ingredients
- 1 cup 2% cottage cheese I love and use Good Culture cottage cheese because of the quality, flavor and thick texture
- 1 cup whole oats
- 2 whole eggs
- 1 tbsp full-fat canned coconut milk
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 2 large egg whites (â…“ cup) *Use real eggs not liquid egg whites
- 1 tsp real maple syrup *Optional for topping

## Directions
1. Place all ingredients into a blender (I use my Blendtec), except egg whites and blend until smooth. Beat egg whites in a stand mixer until stiff peaks start to form. Gently fold egg whites into blended mixture until just combined. Preheat waffle iron while allowing the batter to sit for a few minutes. Next, pour about a cup of batter into a greased waffle iron and cook until set. I used a Belgian waffle maker for this recipe, but a regular waffle iron will work fine, too. Just adjust the amount of the batter to the size of your waffle iron plates.
