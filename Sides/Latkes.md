## Ingredients

- 6 potatoes peeled
- 1 medium onion peeled
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 6-8 tbsp. vegetable or canola oil
- 2 tsp. Kosker salt
- 1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
- sour cream
- applesauce
- 1 sprig dill for garnish (optional)

## Directions

1. Using a box grater or the grating blade of a food processor, grate potatoes and onion. Drain in a colander and press with your hands to remove all of the excess liquid. Put into a large bowl.
1. Add flour to the potatoes and onions. Gently fold in beaten eggs. Add salt and pepper.
1. Heat oil to medium-high heat in a large skillet. Using a large spoon, place potatoes in oil, and flatten with the back of the spoon. Allow them to cook for about 3-4 minutes before turning, and cook for another 3-4 minutes. Test one and adjust time if needed.
1. Put latkes on a wire rack. Place paper towels under the wire rack to catch the excess oil. Arrange latkes on large platter. Serve with sour cream and applesauce on the side. Garnish with a sprig of fresh dill.
