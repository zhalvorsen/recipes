## Ingredients
- 2 pounds carrots, peeled and sliced on diagonal
- 2 tablespoons good quality olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt (I use Kosher)

### Savory Carrots
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley or 2 teaspoons fresh thyme

### Sweet Carrots
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Peel the carrots and cut off the tops. Slice carrots on the diagonal so each piece is about 1/2 inch thick at the widest part (each diagonal cut you make should be about 1 inch apart). Make sure carrots are all cut around the same size to ensure even roasting.
1. Add cut carrots to a very large sheet pan. (I use a 15-inch by 21-inch sheet pan. See Note 1.) FOR SWEET CARROTS: Add olive oil and salt. FOR SAVORY CARROTS: Add olive oil, salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder. Toss to coat all the carrots.
1. Spread carrots into an even layer and roast in the oven for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and quickly toss/flip the carrots then return to the oven. Bake for another 8 to 15 minutes, until caramelized and tender. (Time will vary based on actual oven temperature, how spread out carrots are, and personal preference for how roasted you want the carrots.)
1. Remove the carrots from the oven. FOR SAVORY CARROTS: Toss with fresh herbs and serve immediately. FOR SWEET CARROTS: Whisk together honey, melted butter, and cinnamon in a small bowl until smooth. Drizzle over the carrots and toss. Serve immediately.
1. Leftover carrots will keep well in the fridge in a covered container for 3 to 4 days.
