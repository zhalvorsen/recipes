## Ingredients
- 1 cup warm water
- 1 TBSP yeast
- 1 TBSP sugar
- 1 TBSP oil
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp minced garlic
- 2 tsp onion powder
- 2 1/2- 3 cups flour
- 3 TBSP + 2 TBSP melted butter divided
- 1 tsp garlic salt optional but delicious
- 2-3 cups shredded cheese mozzarella, Parmesan and Monterey Jack are our faves!

## Directions
1. Combine warm water, yeast and sugar in a mixing bowl and let sit for about 3-4 minutes, until yeast is bubbling up. Add in oil, salt, garlic, onion powder and flour. Start with 2 1/2 cups of flour, then add more until the dough cleans the sides of the mixing bowl. (I use a mixer for this part as it makes it just so much easier!)
1. Continue mixing for an additional 3-4 minutes, then cover with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm place for 15 minutes. In cold weather, I like to turn my oven on for about 3 or 4 minutes, then turn it off and let my dough rest in the oven.
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a cookie sheet with non-stick spray.
1. Spray counter top and rolling pin with non-stick cooking spray and roll dough out into a large rectangle about 1/4" thick. Brush with 3 TBSP melted butter and 1 tsp garlic salt, if desired. Sprinkle the top half of your dough rectangle with 2-3 cups shredded cheese. I use 2 cups of cheese, but if you adore those oozing cheese types of recipes, use 3 cups.
1. Take the bottom half of the rectangle and fold it up over the top half, so that it rests on top of the cheese. Press edges to seal.
1. Use a pizza cutter to cut 1"-2" strips of cheesy dough. Gently take each strip and twist a couple times. Some cheese will fall out- if you use 3 cups of cheese, I recommend 2" strips, instead of skinnier 1" ones. Line cookie sheet with twisted dough.
1. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until dough is golden brown and some cheese is bubbling. Let cool. Dip in marinara sauce or ranch dressing for an added treat!
