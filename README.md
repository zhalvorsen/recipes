## Breakfast

### Apple Cinnamon Baked Oatmeal

[Source](https://www.kimscravings.com/healthy-apple-cinnamon-baked-oatmeal/)

#### Ingredients

- 1 3/4 cup unsweetened vanilla almond or cashew milk , (any milk product can be used)
- 2 large eggs
- 1/3 cup maple syrup
- 1/4 cup butter or coconut oil, melted
- 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, (can sub with mashed banana)
- 3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats, (gluten-free as needed)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon allspice
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 cups finely chopped apple , or 1 small apple (I like Honeycrisp)
- Optional for topping: 1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans
- Optional garnish: whipped topping, ice cream, yogurt, nut/seed butter, drizzle of chocolate, maple syrup, and/or fresh fruit

#### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spray a 9×9-inch or 11×7-inch (or other similar size) baking pan with nonstick spray. Stir the liquid ingredients (milk, eggs, maple syrup, melted butter and applesauce) together in one large bowl.
1. Add the dry ingredients (oats, baking powder, spices and salt) to the bowl with the wet ingredients and mix until fully combined, then stir in diced apple. Pour the mixture into prepared baking pan. If desired, top with additional apple slices and/or nuts (or stir nuts into the oatmeal, if using).
1. Bake oatmeal for 35 minutes or until the center appears *almost* set, which will give you a soft oatmeal. For drier and more solid baked oatmeal, bake until center has set. Cool for at least 5 minutes before serving. Spoon or slice and serve with yogurt, almond butter or maple syrup, if desired.

### Belgian Protein Waffles

[Source](https://ameessavorydish.com/belgian-protein-waffles/#wprm-recipe-container-15761)

#### Ingredients

- 1 cup 2% cottage cheese I love and use Good Culture cottage cheese because of the quality, flavor and thick texture
- 1 cup whole oats
- 2 whole eggs
- 1 tbsp full-fat canned coconut milk
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 2 large egg whites (⅓ cup) *Use real eggs not liquid egg whites
- 1 tsp real maple syrup *Optional for topping

#### Directions

1. Place all ingredients into a blender (I use my Blendtec), except egg whites and blend until smooth. Beat egg whites in a stand mixer until stiff peaks start to form. Gently fold egg whites into blended mixture until just combined. Preheat waffle iron while allowing the batter to sit for a few minutes. Next, pour about a cup of batter into a greased waffle iron and cook until set. I used a Belgian waffle maker for this recipe, but a regular waffle iron will work fine, too. Just adjust the amount of the batter to the size of your waffle iron plates.

### The Ultimate Chocolate Granola

[Source](https://pinchofyum.com/the-ultimate-chocolate-granola)

#### Ingredients

- 3 cups rolled oats
- 1 1/4 cups sliced raw almonds
- 3/4 cup unsweetened coconut flakes
- 1/2 cup cocoa powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup turbinado sugar
- 2/3 cup melted coconut oil (measured in liquid form)
- 1/3 cup maple syrup
- 1 teaspoon vanilla (optional)
- 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips
- sea salt for finishing

#### Directions

1. **Make**: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees Fahrenheit. Toss the oats, almonds, coconut, cocoa, salt, and 1/3 cup of the sugar in a large bowl. Whisk the melted coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla together. Set aside. Pour the liquids over the dry ingredients and stir to combine. Spread the granola into two large jelly roll pans in an even layer.
1. **Bake**: for 50 minutes total, stopping about halfway through to check the granola and shake or stir the pan if needed. After 50 minutes, sprinkle the chocolate chips over the top of the granola, return to the oven for 5-10 minutes until chocolate chips are very soft. Sprinkle with the remaining turbinado sugar and coarse sea salt to taste. The added sugar and salt should stick the outside of the chocolate chips. *YES*
1. **Store**: Let the granola stand for 1-2 hours. Gently scoop the granola into jars or an airtight container for storing. The advantage of doing this when the chocolate chips are still soft (at the 1-2 hour mark) is that it makes for great texture once it cools – the chocolate chips will sort of melt their way into the clusters and harden within each individual granola cluster. SO GOOD. You can also leave the granola out overnight or for several hours until the chocolate chips are fully cooled and hardened if you want to preserve the shape of the individual chocolate chip pieces in the granola.

### Orange Muffins

[Source](https://buttermilkbysam.com/orange-muffins/#wprm-recipe-container-5524)

#### Ingredients

##### Muffins

- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- zest of two oranges
- 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 2 1/4 cups all purpose flour

- granulated sugar for sprinkling (if not glazing)

##### (Optional) Orange Glaze

- 1 cup powdered sugar preferably made with tapioca starch
- 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice
- pinch fine sea salt

#### Directions

1. In a large bowl, add the sugar and zest the oranges over it. Rub the zest and sugar between your fingers until it’s well-distributed and becomes like wet sand.
1. Add the eggs and using a hand mixer, beat the mixture until very light and fluffy, about 3-5 minutes. With the mixer on, slowly drizzle in the olive oil. Beat to combine.
1. Add the flour, vanilla, salt and baking soda and fold gently. Then, with the mixer on drizzle in the kefir and orange juice, beating until smooth. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set in the fridge for 2-4 hours or overnight.
1. Once it’s time to bake, preheat the oven to 400 F. Line two 12 cup muffin trays with liners, six in each, alternating cavities so that no muffins are next to each other.
1. Portion the batter into the cups, filling ¾ of the way. Sprinkle granulated sugar on top and bake for about 18 minutes, or until you can press the top of a muffin and it springs back.
1. To make the glaze: whisk all the ingredients together in a bowl then dip the completely cooled muffins in the glaze, face down. If the glaze is runny, add more powdered sugar. The goal is a thick but pourable consistency.

### Pumpkin Protein Pancakes

[Source](https://dishingouthealth.com/pumpkin-protein-pancakes/#wprm-recipe-container-15627)

#### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup pumpkin puree
- 3/4 cup cottage cheese (full-fat or 2%)
- 2 large eggs
- 2 Tbsp. maple syrup
- 1 1/2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
- 2 tsp. baking powder
- 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice
- 1/4 tsp. kosher salt
- Oil or butter for cooking
- Optional add-ins or toppings: Chopped pecans or walnuts, chocolate chips, maple butter, almond butter, and/or maple syrup.

#### Directions

1. Add pumpkin puree, cottage cheese, eggs, and maple syrup to a blender. (Adding the wet ingredients first helps lubricate the blade and aid in smoother blending.) Next, add the dry ingredients (oats, baking powder, pumpkin pie spice, and salt).
1. Blend until smooth, starting on low speed and increasing to medium-high. (If you plan on mixing in nuts or chocolate chips, stir them in after blending.) Let batter sit in the blender while you preheat a skillet (or griddle) over medium heat. Grease with oil or butter.
1. Once the pan is hot, add 1/4 cup batter (the batter will be thick) to the pan for each pancake.
1. Use the back of a spoon to smooth out batter to create a rounded pancake. Cook for 2 to 4 minutes, or until pancakes slightly puff up and bubbles form around the edges. Gently flip, and cook another 2 minutes, or until golden brown on the underside. (Note: if the pancakes start browning too quickly, reduce heat to medium-low to prevent burning.)
1. Serve warm with toppings of choice.

Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long). Cool completely before slicing.*** Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!

### Chocolate Chip Cut Out Cookies

[Source](https://www.chocolatemoosey.com/chocolate-chip-cut-out-cookies-2/)

#### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup (4 ounces, 112 grams, or 8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, softened
- 1/4 cup (54 grams) packed brown sugar (soft and moist, not dry and crumbly)
- 2 tablespoons (28 grams) granulated sugar
- 1 large egg yolk, room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 + 1/4 cups (149 grams) all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon table salt
- 3/4 cup (115 grams) mini semisweet chocolate chips
- 1 recipe Small Batch Buttercream Frosting (get recipe here)
- Additional 1/4 cup (40 grams) mini semisweet chocolate chips if piping chocolate glaze

#### Directions

1. In a large mixing bowl on medium-high speed (with paddle attachment if using stand mixer), beat together butter, brown sugar, and sugar until light and creamy, about 1-2 minutes.
1. Scrape down the bowl then beat in egg yolk and vanilla.
1. Turn the speed down to low then gradually beat in flour and salt then add mini chocolate chips. A dough will form, but if it seems too crumbly, you may need to beat another 30-60 seconds on low for it to come together.
1. Remove the dough from the bowl and divide into two pieces. Place each piece between two sheets of plastic wrap. Roll each dough flat until 1/4-inch thick. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or until firm.
1. Working with one dough piece at a time, remove the top plastic wrap then cut into desired shapes. As you run out of dough, gather up the scraps and reroll. If the dough gets too warm and sticky, refrigerate until cold again.
1. Repeat with the second dough piece. Place shapes on 2 ungreased cookie sheets.
1. Preheat oven to 350F/177C. Refrigerate shapes on the cookie sheets while the oven preheats (roughly 15-20 minutes). You want everything to be cold to minimize spreading.
1. Bake cookies 9-11 minutes or until golden brown on the edges. Let sit for 5 minutes then carefully transfer to wire racks to cool completely.
1. Decorate with buttercream frosting and chocolate glaze (see below), if desired.

### Soft & Chewy Gingerbread Cookies

[Source](https://bluebowlrecipes.com/best-soft-gingerbread-cookies/#wprm-recipe-container-4529)

#### Ingredients

##### Cookies

- 1 cup salted butter, softened at room temperature
- 1 cup dark brown sugar, packed
- 1/2 cup molasses
- 3 cups all-purpose flour, spooned & leveled or weighed out 390 grams
- 2 1/2 tsp ground ginger
- 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- pinch of nutmeg
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt

##### Icing

- 2 cups powdered sugar
- 1 and 1/2 tbsp meringue powder
- 4-6 tbsp water

#### Directions

1. Make the Cookie Dough: Beat butter in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until creamed. Add the brown sugar and mix until well creamed together, about 1 minute. Add the molasses and mix until combined. Add the dry ingredients, and mix until a dough forms. Add 1-2 tsp of milk if your dough is a bit crumbly (see photos above).
1. 1 cup salted butter, softened at room temperature,1 cup dark brown sugar, packed,1/2 cup molasses,3 cups all-purpose flour, spooned & leveled or weighed out,2 1/2 tsp ground ginger,1 1/2 tsp cinnamon,pinch of nutmeg,1/2 tsp baking soda,1/2 tsp salt
1. Roll and Chill: Divide the dough into two halves, and roll each one out to 3/8" thickness between sheets of parchment paper. (Use a ruler to check this, or just eyeball halfway between 1/4 and 1/2 inch. This is the perfect thickness for these cookies - trust! Even 1/2" is perfect - but don't go lower than 3/8")
1. Place the rolled dough, still sandwiched in parchment paper, on a baking sheet and cover loosely with a clean kitchen towel. Chill for 1-2 hours in the fridge or shorter in the freezer, until completely chilled and firm.
1. Cut out Cookies: Preheat your oven to 350° F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Cut shapes out of the chilled dough and place cookies a couple of inches apart on your prepared baking sheet. If the cookies are no longer firm and cold to the touch from working with the dough, pop the pan back in the fridge or freezer for 5 to 15 minutes to re-chill so that the cookies hold their shape when baked (it's fine to bake them from frozen).
1. While the cookies are baking, combine your dough scraps, roll back out, and cut out more cookies. Repeat this until all remaining dough is gone! You will need to chill the dough for a bit again once you roll the scraps back out so that it's firm enough to cut the shapes easily. (Roll it back out between the parchment each time to keep things easy.)
1. Bake: Bake cookies for 8-9 minutes. The cookies should appear just set, and will look a tad puffy. The centers may look a tad underdone. Don't be tempted to over bake them! They will set up to the perfect soft baked cookies. Let them cool on baking sheet for about 10 minutes before and transferring to a wire rack to finish cooling.
1. Tip: Bake a single test cookie first if you’re worried you’ll underbake them - you’ll see that 8 minutes yields the perfect cookie!
1. Decorate: Decorate by dipping the cooled cookies in this glaze (swap the maple syrup for milk, if desired), dusting them with powdered sugar, or piping them with royal icing.
1. Make Royal Icing: Combine all ingredients in a large bowl, starting with 4 tablespoons of water, and mix on high speed with an electric mixer for about 1 and 1/2 minutes. When the icing is the right consistency, you should be able to drizzle some of it into the bowl, and watch it sit on the surface of the mixture for 5-10 seconds before melting back in. If it's too thick, add 1 tablespoon of water at a time. If it's too thin, beat it for another 30 seconds to a minute, or add a bit more powdered sugar, a little at a time, beating between each addition.
1. Add the royal icing to a piping bag fitted with a wilton #1 tip (this is what I use to create the details on the cookies pictured). Pipe desired designs. Snowflakes are easy - you basically draw lines to connect the points, then make little Vs on each line. You can even use gel food coloring to tint the royal icing. While the icing is still wet, sprinkle on a little white sanding sugar for a pretty sparkle (optional, but that is what I use).
1. 2 cups powdered sugar,1 and 1/2 tbsp meringue powder,4-6 tbsp water
1. Serve + Store: Enjoy cookies once decorated! Be sure to let the icing set completely before storing. Store cooled, set cookies in an airtight container at room temp for 4-6 days, or in the fridge for 6-8 (let cookies come to room temperature for a bit if they've been chilled before serving).
1. Cookie Dough and Cookie Make-Ahead Tips: The dough can be made, rolled out, and covered well and stored in the fridge for 1-2 days before baking. The cookies can be baked, cooled, and stored in an airtight container at room temp for 1-2 days before decorating.
1. Royal Icing Make-Ahead Tips: The royal icing can be made and stored in the fridge in an airtight container for 1-2 days before using, or leftovers can be stored in this same way and used for other decorating within 1-2 days. Simply re-mix for about 10-20 seconds with a mixer to loosen things back up after being in the fridge. The same guidelines from above can be used to adjust the icing's consistency.

## Dinner

### Crispy Air Fryer Tofu

[Source](https://thenaturalnurturer.com/crispy-air-fryer-tofu/)

#### Ingredients

- 16 ounce block firm or extra firm tofu
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch or arrowroot starch
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon coconut aminos or soy sauce if gluten free isn't needed

#### Directions

1. Cut tofu into cubes and arrange on a clean towel or paper towels.
1. Place another towel on top of the tofu and place a cutting board on the towel. Place something heavy (I use my cast iron skillet) to weigh down and gently press out the moisture from the tofu. Let sit for for 15-30 minutes.
1. Once tofu has been pressed, place in a medium bowl. Sprinkle tofu with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot powder. This will help the oil and coconut aminos stick to the tofu and give it that crisp outside. Toss the tofu piece in the cornstarch/arrowroot to coat. It’s ok if the tofu isn’t perfectly coated.
1. Next, drizzle with oil and coconut aminos. Toss to coat again.
1. Preheat air fryer to 375℉ for 3 minutes. Once warmed up, place tofu in air fryer basket in an even layer.
1. Cook for 12 to 15 minutes, depending how crisp you want your tofu. Shake air fryer basket at the 5 minute mark to move tofu around so that it evenly cooks.
1. Once done cooking, remove immediately from air fryer and enjoy as part of a stir fry, salad, over rice or with your favorite dipping sauce.

### Black Bean Soup

[Source](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/black-bean-soup.html)

#### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 2 medium yellow onions, roughly chopped
- 4 large garlic cloves, crushed and peeled
- 2 carrots, peeled and roughly chopped
- 2 (15-ounce) cans black beans, drained and rinsed
- 4 cups low-sodium chicken broth (or vegetable broth for vegetarian option)
- 3/4 teaspoon oregano
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1-3/4 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- Scant 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
- 1/3 cup sour cream
- Handful chopped fresh cilantro

#### Directions

1. Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large soup pan. Add the onions, garlic cloves and carrots and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are soft and translucent, about 8 minutes. Do not brown.
2. Add the black beans, chicken broth, oregano, coriander, cumin, cayenne pepper and salt and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover and simmer gently for about 15 minutes.
3. Puree the soup using a hand-held immersion blender until very smooth and creamy. (Alternatively, you can use a standard blender to puree the soup in batches; see note.) Stir in the lime juice and season with salt and pepper to taste. Ladle the soup into bowls and top each bowl with a dollop of sour cream and freshly chopped cilantro.

**Note:** If using a standard blender, puree the soup in batches, being careful not to fill the jar more than halfway. Be sure to leave the hole in the lid open and loosely cover with a dish towel to allow the heat to escape. Pour the blended soup into a clean pot.

**Freezer-Friendly Instructions:** The soup can be frozen for up to 3 months. Defrost the soup in the refrigerator for 12 hours and then reheat it on the stovetop over medium heat until hot. (It may thicken up a bit while in the freezer; if so, just thin it out with a bit of water or broth while reheating.)

- 4 ounces (1 cup) grated Monterey Jack cheese
- 2 ounces (1/2 cup) crumbled feta cheese
- 2 small cans (4 ounces each) diced green chiles
- 1 medium jalapeño, seeded and minced
- 2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced
- 2 tablespoons lime juice
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
- 1/4 teaspoon salt, more to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper

#### Remaining Ingredients

- 2 cups (16 ounces) mild salsa verde, either homemade or store-bought
- 10 corn tortillas

1. Slice the sweet potatoes in half lengthwise and coat the flat sides lightly with olive oil. Place the sweet potatoes flat-side down on the baking sheet. Bake until they’re tender and cooked through, about 30 to 35 minutes. Leave the oven on, since we’ll bake the assembled enchiladas soon (no temperature adjustments necessary).
1. Meanwhile, pour enough salsa verde into a 9 by 13-inch baking dish to lightly cover the bottom (about ½ cup). In a medium mixing bowl, combine all of the remaining filling ingredients.
1. Once the sweet potatoes are cooked through and cool enough to handle, scoop out the insides with a spoon. Discard the potato skins, and lightly mash the sweet potatoes with a fork or the back of a spoon.
1. Stir the mashed sweet potato into the bowl of filling, and season to taste with additional salt (I added ¼ teaspoon) and pepper.
1. Warm up your tortillas, one by one in a skillet, or all at once in a microwave so they don’t break when you bend them. Wrap them in a clean tea towel so they stay warm.
1. Working with one tortilla at a time, spread about ½ cup filling down the center each tortilla, then wrap both sides over the filling and place it in your baking dish. Repeat for all of the tortillas.
1. Top with the remaining salsa verde and cheese. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, until sauce is bubbling and the cheese is lightly golden.
1. Let the enchiladas cool for about 5 minutes. Whisk the sour cream and water together to make a drizzly sour cream sauce. Drizzle it back and forth over the enchiladas, then top them with cilantro and red onion. Serve.

### Instant Pot Broccoli Cheddar Soup

[Source](https://www.365daysofcrockpot.com/instant-pot-broccoli-cheddar-soup/)

#### Ingredients

- 1 Tbsp butter
- 1 medium yellow onion, diced
- 2 or 3 celery ribs, diced
- 2 or 3 carrots, match-stick style or grated or diced
- 4 cups coarsely chopped fresh broccoli florets
- 3 cups chicken broth (or 3 cups of water and 3 tsp of Better than Bouillon Chicken Base)
- 1/4 cup butter
- 1/4 cup flour
- 2 cups milk
- 1 (8 oz) block of sharp cheddar, grated
- 1/2 tsp salt
- Freshly ground pepper, to taste
- Optional: cornstarch and water

#### Directions

1. Turn your Instant Pot to the saute function (“more”) and melt the 1 Tbsp of butter. When the butter is melted add in the diced onion. Saute for 3 minutes.
1. Add in the celery, carrots, broccoli and chicken broth.
1. Cover the Instant Pot and lock the lid in place. Make sure valve is on “sealing.” Set the manual button (or pressure cook button) to 1 minute.
1. While the pot heats up and reaches pressure melt your 1/4 cup of butter in a glass dish in the microwave (you can also melt in a pan on the stove). Slowly whisk in the flour until a creamy mixture is formed. Set aside. If desired (to speed up the process) you can also heat up the milk at this time. Grate your cheddar and set aside.
1. When the timer beeps indicating the time is up on your Instant Pot let the pot sit there for 5 minutes and then move the valve to “venting.” Remove the lid when you can.
1. Turn the Instant Pot back to the saute function. Whisk one cup of the broth from the soup into the butter and flour mixture. Then add that whole mixture into the pot. Stir until the soup thickens. Stir in the milk, until it heats through (this is why heating it beforehand can speed up the process). Stir in the cheese, until it melts. Stir in the salt and pepper. If you want a thicker soup you can mix 2 Tbsp of cornstarch with 2 Tbsp of cold water in a small bowl and then stir the cornstarch slurry into the pot. This will produce a nice, thick soup.
1. Ladle into bowls and serve. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. Although I personally haven’t tried freezing this soup, I believe that it would freeze well.

### Grandma Allison's Creamless Creamy Tomato Soup

[Source](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/4412-creamless-creamy-tomato-soup?incode=MCSCM00L0&ref=new_search_experience_1&t=1633892058)

#### Ingredients

- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
- 1 medium onion, chopped medium (about 1 cup)
- 3 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed
- 1 pinch hot red pepper flakes
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 (28-ounce) cans of whole tomatoes packed in juice
- 1 tbsp brown sugar
- 3 large slices good-quality sandwich bread, crusts removed, torn into 1-inch pieces
- 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth or vegetable broth
- 2 tbsp brandy (optional)
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh chives

#### Directions

##### Before you begin

If half of the soup fills your blender by more than two-thirds, process the soup in three batches. You can also use an immersion blender to process the soup directly in the pot. For an even smoother soup, pass the pureed mixture through a fine-mesh strainer before stirring in the broth in step 2. To make this dish vegetarian, use vegetable broth in place of chicken broth.

##### Instructions

1. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion, garlic, red pepper flakes (if using), and bay leaf. Cook, stirring frequently, until onion is translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and their juice. Using potato masher, mash until no pieces bigger than 2 inches remain. Stir in sugar and bread; bring soup to boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until bread is completely saturated and starts to break down, about 5 minutes. Remove and discard bay leaf.
2. Transfer half of soup to blender. Add 1 tablespoon oil and process until soup is smooth and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to large bowl and repeat with remaining soup and oil. Rinse out Dutch oven and return soup to pot. Stir in chicken broth and brandy (if using). Return soup to boil and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve soup in individual bowls. Sprinkle each portion with pepper and chives and drizzle with olive oil.

### One Pot Orzo with Asparagus and Peas

#### Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 medium red onion
- 2 garlic cloves, sliced
- ¾ lb (350 g) asparagus, trimmed and cut into bite-size pieces

### Pierogi

[Source](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/homemade-pierogi-recipe)

#### Ingredients

##### Dough

- 2 cups (240g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 cup (113g) sour cream
- 4 tablespoons (57g) butter, room temperature

##### Filling

- 1 cup (227g) mashed potatoes, warm
- 1 cup (113g) sharp cheddar cheese, shredded

##### To finish

- 4 tablespoons (57g) butter, cold
- 2 large (156g) shallots, diced; or one medium (156g) onion, sliced

#### Directions

##### To make the dough

1. Mix together the flour and salt. Add the egg to the flour and combine. The dough will be quite clumpy at this stage.
2. Work in the sour cream and soft butter until the dough comes together in a slightly rough, slightly sticky ball.
3. Using just your fingertips, knead and fold the dough without adding additional flour until the dough becomes less sticky but still quite moist.
4. Wrap the dough well in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes, or up to 48 hours.

##### To make the filling

1. Combine the warm mashed potato and cheese. Stir and mash until the cheese is melted and the filling is cool to the touch. Taste and adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper.

##### To fill the pierogi

1. Roll half the dough 1/8" thick. Use a 2" round cutter to cut circles of dough. Repeat with the other half of the dough. Save the scraps; these can be snipped into small pieces and added to simmering soups.
2. Place 1 1/2 teaspoons of filling on each round of dough. Gently fold the dough over, forming a pocket around the filling. Pinch the edges of the pierogi to seal, then seal again with the tines of a fork.
3. At this point the pierogi can be frozen for up to 4 weeks, or refrigerated overnight, or cooked in a large stockpot of boiling salted water. Only cook about 10 pierogi at a time, so that they have room to float without sticking. When the pierogi float, they're done. The time will vary depending on if they're fresh or frozen.
4. Sauté the shallots or onion in the butter in a large skillet until the onion begins to brown. Add the drained pierogi and cook until browned and crisped. Serve hot with additional sour cream, applesauce, or other condiments.

#### Tips

- If your filling is a bit watery due to the potatoes, add a tablespoon of flour to help thicken it up.

1. Knead rested dough for 3 minutes. Cut into 2 equal pieces and shape each into a ball. Place on a heavily floured surface, cover with dampened cloth, and let rest and rise for 3 to 4 hours at room temperature or for 8 to 24 hours in the refrigerator. (If you refrigerate the dough, remove it 30 to 45 minutes before you begin to shape it for pizza.)
1. To make pizza, place each dough ball on a heavily floured surface and use your fingers to stretch it, then your hands to shape it into rounds or squares. Top and bake.

### Baked Quinoa Black Bean Falafel

[Source](https://minimalistbaker.com/baked-quinoa-black-bean-falafel/#wprm-recipe-container-34164)

#### Ingredients

- 1 cup cooked and cooled quinoa (make sure it's cooked and completely cooled before using)
- 1 15-ounce can black beans (rinsed, drained, dried)
- 1/4 cup pumpkin seeds (raw or roasted)
- 5 cloves garlic (skin removed and crushed)
- 1/2 tsp sea salt, plus more to taste
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp ground coriander
- 2 Tbsp tomato paste
- 2 Tbsp coconut aminos
- 1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce (omit for less spicy falafel)
- 1 tsp nutritional yeast (optional)

#### Directions

1. If you haven’t prepared your quinoa yet, do so now (make sure it’s cooked and cooled completely before use).
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Add rinsed, dried black beans to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes or until beans appear cracked and feel dry to the touch (see beans in food processor photo). Remove beans from the oven and then increase oven heat to 375 degrees F (190C).
1. Add black beans to a food processor along with pumpkin seeds and garlic (see photo) and pulse into a loose meal. Then add cooked/cooled quinoa, salt, cumin, coriander, tomato paste, coconut aminos, chipotle pepper in adobo, and nutritional yeast (optional). Blend to combine until a textured dough forms (you're not looking for a purée).
1. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more coconut aminos for saltiness/depth of flavor, adobo sauce for heat, cumin for smokiness, or salt for overall flavor.
1. Scoop out 1 1/2 Tbsp amounts (using this scoop or a Tablespoon) and gently form into small discs using your hands. Add formed falafel to a parchment-lined baking sheet.
1. Bake for 15 minutes. Then flip to ensure even baking and bake for 10-15 minutes more or until golden brown and crispy on the edges.
1. These falafel are delicious with hummus, garlic dill sauce, baba ganoush, or tahini sauce. Try garnishing with chili garlic sauce for extra heat. Serve over greens or in pita, or enjoy as is!
1. Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days. To freeze, either freeze once baked and cooled OR before baking. Then add to a freezer-safe container and freeze up to 1 month. Reheat in a 375 degree F (190 C) oven until warmed through.

### Spicy Peanut Mango Noodles

[Source](https://yestoyolks.com/2019/02/28/quick-easy-spicy-peanut-noodles-with-mango/)

#### Ingredients

##### Sauce Ingredients

- 1/2 cup fresh mango, cubed
- 1/3 cup creamy peanut butter
- 1/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon honey or brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon chile garlic paste (I like sambal oelek)
- 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
- 4 garlic cloves, minced or pressed
- 1/4 cup warm water

##### Noodles Ingredients

- 8 oz rice noodles (or other long pasta of choice)
- 2 teaspoons canola oil
- 1 red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
- 1 cup shredded carrots (you can shred them yourself but I buy the pre-shredded ones from the store to make my life easier)
- 1/2 cup sugar snap peas (I buy them frozen – no need to defrost them here)
- 1 mango, peeled, pitted, and thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup Thai basil, chopped (regular basil works too)
- 1/4 cup cilantro, chopped
- Juice of 1 lime
- 4 scallions, chopped
- 1/2 cup peanuts, chopped

#### Directions

##### Start

1. Soak the noodles in hot water, according to the package directions. Once tender, drain, rinse, and set aside.
2. Depending on the brand of rice noodle you are using, the recommended soaking time may be anywhere between 15-30 minutes, so I like to do this step first. That way, the noodles are ready and waiting for me when I need them.

##### Sauce Directions

1. Combine all the ingredients except the water in a food processor.
2. Pulse to combine, scraping down the sides a couple times, and then run the machine until the mixture is smooth.
3. Stream in the warm water, a tablespoon or so at a time, until the sauce thins out a bit. It should be loose at this point – the starch from the noodles will help thicken it up.
4. Season, to taste, with additional honey, chile paste, or soy sauce (I find that sauces like this are definitely a “to taste” kind of deal. Make it as spicy, sweet, or salty as you prefer).

##### Noodle Directions

1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
2. Add the bell pepper, shredded carrots, and snap peas and cook for 2-3 minutes or until they are tender crisp.
3. Add the drained noodles, along with the sauce, and toss to combine everything.
4. Add in the mango, basil, cilantro, lime juice, and scallions and continue tossing and stirring for a couple minutes or until everything is warmed through and evenly coated in the sauce.
5. Serve immediately, garnished with additional herbs, the chopped peanuts, and lime wedges.

### Sweet Potato Chipotle Chicken Skillet

[Source](https://lillieeatsandtells.com/sweet-potato-chipotle-chicken-skillet/#wprm-recipe-container-12228)

#### Ingredients

- 4 Medium sweet potatoes, chopped into bite-sized cubes
- 1 Small onion, chopped
- 2-3 Bell peppers, chopped
- 3 cups Riced cauliflower
- 2 Medium zucchini, chopped
- 4 Frozen garlic cubes, or minced cloves
- 10-oz can Rotel, or canned tomatoes, drained
- 4-oz can Green chilis, drained
- 1/4 cup Reduced-fat cream cheese
- 1 Tbsp Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, minced or blended if whole*
- 2 Tbsp Cumin
- 2 Tbsp Chili powder
- 1.5 Tbsp Garlic powder
- 1.5 Tbsp Kosher salt
- 1 Tbsp Dried oregano
- 1 Tbsp Paprika
- 6 cups Rotisserie or Cooked chicken breast, chopped or shredded
- 1 cup Cilantro, chopped

#### Directions

1. Heat a LARGE, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium high heat with a spritz of olive oil. Add sweet potatoes and cook covered, stirring often for about 10 minutes to soften. Add onion, bell pepper, and cauliflower rice (throw in a pinch of kosher salt to help veggies release their water) and cook for another 10-15 minutes until the veggies are fragrant and cauliflower is pretty tender.
1. Add chopped zucchini, and garlic. Cover and cook for another 5 minutes stirring often, until everything is tender to your liking. Add drained rotel, green chilis, cream cheese, chipotle peppers, and spices. Combine well until the cream cheese is melted, then mix in your cooked chicken and fresh cilantro! Do it carefully since your pan will be FULL.*
1. For the cheese lovers in our family, we like to top half with cheese and broil for a minute to melt!
1. Finish with a drizzle of the enchilada sauce, some fresh cilantro leaves or chopped green onion and serve immediately. You can eat it straight like a casserole, or over greens, or rice, or piled into tortillas or alongside tortilla chips! We love to add some fresh avocado and either some sour cream or one of my favorite green sauces. (This dairy-free green sauce, this jalapeño avocado dressing, or this green goddess dressing.) So good!

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a small bowl, whisk together the coconut oil, brown sugar, minced garlic, cinnamon and cayenne. Place the sweet potatoes on a baking sheet and pour mixture over the top. Season with salt and pepper and toss well to coat. Roast for 20-30 minutes until sweet potatoes are fork-tender, tossing a bit halfway through. They should get a little crispy on the edges.

While the sweet potatoes are cooking, you can toast the pecans on the stovetop: Add pecans to a pan and place over medium heat, stirring occasionally for 2-5 minutes until pecans are fragrant and slightly golden brown on edges. Remove from heat and transfer to a cutting board. After a few minutes, chop the pecans into big pieces. Set aside.
3. In a mason jar or small bowl, add all of the dressing ingredients. Shake or mix well to combine. Taste and add additional salt/pepper, if necessary.
4. In a large bowl, add the spinach, pomegranate seeds, pear slices, and cooked sweet potatoes. Top with toasted pecans and goat cheese crumbles. Drizzle with desired amount of dressing, then toss to coat. Add to bowls and serve with extra pecans and goat cheese, if desired

### Vegetable Lasagna

[Source](https://cookieandkate.com/best-vegetable-lasagna-recipe/)

#### Ingredients

##### Veggies

- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 large carrots, chopped (about 1 cup)
- 1 red bell pepper, chopped
- 1 medium zucchini, chopped
- 1 medium yellow onion, chopped
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 5 to 6 ounces baby spinach

##### Tomato sauce (or substitute 2 cups prepared marinara sauce)

- 1 large can (28 ounces) diced tomatoes
- 1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh basil + additional for garnish
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes

##### Remaining ingredients

- 2 cups (16 ounces) low-fat cottage cheese, divided
- 1/4 teaspoon salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 9 no-boil lasagna noodles*
- 8 ounces (2 cups) freshly grated low-moisture, part-skim mozzarella cheese

#### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
1. To prepare the veggies: In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Once shimmering, add the carrots, bell pepper, zucchini, yellow onion, and salt. Cook, stirring every couple of minutes, until the veggies are golden on the edges, about 8 to 12 minutes.
1. Add a few large handfuls of spinach. Cook, stirring frequently, until the spinach has wilted. Repeat with remaining spinach and cook until all of the spinach has wilted, about 3 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside.
1. Meanwhile, to prepare the tomato sauce: Pour the tomatoes into a mesh sieve or fine colander and drain off the excess juice for a minute. Then, transfer the drained tomatoes to the bowl of a food processor. Add the basil, olive oil, garlic, salt, and red pepper flakes.
1. Pulse the mixture about 10 times, until the tomatoes have broken down to an easily spreadable consistency. Pour the mixture into a bowl for later (you should have a little over 2 cups sauce). Rinse out the food processor and return it to the machine.
1. Pour half of the cottage cheese (1 cup) into the processor and blend it until smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer the mixture to large mixing bowl. No need to rinse out the bowl of the food processor this time; just put it back onto the machine because you’ll need it later.
1. Transfer the cooked veggies and spinach mixture to the bowl of the food processor. Pulse until they are more finely chopped (but not puréed!), about 5 to 7 times, stopping to scrape down the sides as necessary. Transfer the mixture to the bowl of whipped cottage cheese. Top with the remaining cottage cheese, then add ¼ to ½ teaspoon salt (to taste) and lots of freshly ground black pepper. Stir to combine. Now it’s lasagna assembly time!
1. Spread ½ cup tomato sauce evenly over the bottom of a 9” by 9” baking dish. Layer 3 lasagna noodles on top (snap off their ends to fit, and/or overlap their edges as necessary). Spread half of the cottage cheese mixture evenly over the noodles. Top with ¾ cup tomato sauce, then sprinkle ½ cup shredded cheese on top.
1. Top with 3 more noodles, followed by the remaining cottage cheese mixture (we’re skipping the tomato sauce in this layer.) Sprinkle ½ cup shredded cheese on top.
1. Top with 3 more noodles, then spread ¾ cup tomato sauce over the top (you may have a little sauce leftover) to evenly cover the noodles. Sprinkle evenly with 1 cup shredded cheese.
1. Wrap a sheet of parchment paper or foil around the top of the lasagna (don’t let it come into contact with the cheese). Bake, covered, for 18 minutes, then remove the cover, rotate the pan by 180° and continue cooking for about 10 to 15 more minutes, until the top is turning spotty brown.
1. Remove from oven and let the lasagna cool for 15 to 20 minutes, so it has time to set and cool down to a reasonable temperature. Sprinkle additional basil over the top, then slice and serve.

### White Bean Soup

- 1 cup (7 oz - 200 grams), frozen spinach * (optional)
- 2 medium-size potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
- 1 Tbsp olive oil, plus more for serving
- 1 Tbsp tomato paste
- 1/3 cup (80 ml) white wine
- 1 sprig rosemary (or 1 Tbsp of chopped fresh leaves/1/2 tsp of dried)
- 2 cups (500 ml) vegetable broth or hot water
- 1/2 tsp paprika (optional)
- 1/2 tsp fine salt, plus more to taste
- 1/8 tsp black pepper, plus more to taste

#### Directions

1. Warm the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the diced onion, carrot, and celery. Cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened and is turning translucent, about 5 minutes.
2. Add the garlic, beans, tomato paste, potatoes, rosemary (whole sprig, chopped, or dried, whatever it's easier for you) and paprika (if you use it). Cook stirring frequently, about 1 minute.
3. Add the wine, stir well and let it simmer until it has evaporated, cooking for another minute.
4. Then add the frozen spinach, the vegetable broth and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Raise the heat and bring the mixture to a boil, then cover the pot, reduce heat and cook gently for 15 minutes.
5. When the potatoes are soft and the soup is thick and creamy, remove the pot from heat, then remove the sprig rosemary*. Taste and season with salt and pepper. (I usually add a pinch of salt at the beginning + 1/2 tsp later. You might need more salt, depending on your vegetable broth and on your personal preferences.)*
6. Divide into bowls, drizzle with olive oil or extra virgin olive oil, and more freshly ground black pepper if you like. Serve with crusty whole grain bread and, if you don't keep it vegan, add freshly grated parmesan cheese for extra flavor. Enjoy!

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a cookie sheet with non-stick spray.
1. Spray counter top and rolling pin with non-stick cooking spray and roll dough out into a large rectangle about 1/4" thick. Brush with 3 TBSP melted butter and 1 tsp garlic salt, if desired. Sprinkle the top half of your dough rectangle with 2-3 cups shredded cheese. I use 2 cups of cheese, but if you adore those oozing cheese types of recipes, use 3 cups.
1. Take the bottom half of the rectangle and fold it up over the top half, so that it rests on top of the cheese. Press edges to seal.
1. Use a pizza cutter to cut 1"-2" strips of cheesy dough. Gently take each strip and twist a couple times. Some cheese will fall out- if you use 3 cups of cheese, I recommend 2" strips, instead of skinnier 1" ones. Line cookie sheet with twisted dough.
1. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until dough is golden brown and some cheese is bubbling. Let cool. Dip in marinara sauce or ranch dressing for an added treat!

### Roasted Carrots

[Source](https://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/roasted-carrots/)

#### Ingredients

- 2 pounds carrots, peeled and sliced on diagonal
- 2 tablespoons good quality olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt (I use Kosher)

##### Savory Carrots

- 1/4 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon paprika

##### Sweet Carrots

- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

#### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Peel the carrots and cut off the tops. Slice carrots on the diagonal so each piece is about 1/2 inch thick at the widest part (each diagonal cut you make should be about 1 inch apart). Make sure carrots are all cut around the same size to ensure even roasting.
1. Add cut carrots to a very large sheet pan. (I use a 15-inch by 21-inch sheet pan. See Note 1.) FOR SWEET CARROTS: Add olive oil and salt. FOR SAVORY CARROTS: Add olive oil, salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder. Toss to coat all the carrots.
1. Spread carrots into an even layer and roast in the oven for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and quickly toss/flip the carrots then return to the oven. Bake for another 8 to 15 minutes, until caramelized and tender. (Time will vary based on actual oven temperature, how spread out carrots are, and personal preference for how roasted you want the carrots.)
1. Remove the carrots from the oven. FOR SAVORY CARROTS: Toss with fresh herbs and serve immediately. FOR SWEET CARROTS: Whisk together honey, melted butter, and cinnamon in a small bowl until smooth. Drizzle over the carrots and toss. Serve immediately.
