## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup (4 ounces, 112 grams, or 8 tablespoons) unsalted butter, softened
- 1/4 cup (54 grams) packed brown sugar (soft and moist, not dry and crumbly)
- 2 tablespoons (28 grams) granulated sugar
- 1 large egg yolk, room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 + 1/4 cups (149 grams) all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon table salt
- 3/4 cup (115 grams) mini semisweet chocolate chips
- 1 recipe Small Batch Buttercream Frosting (get recipe here)
- Additional 1/4 cup (40 grams) mini semisweet chocolate chips if piping chocolate glaze

## Directions

1. In a large mixing bowl on medium-high speed (with paddle attachment if using stand mixer), beat together butter, brown sugar, and sugar until light and creamy, about 1-2 minutes.
1. Scrape down the bowl then beat in egg yolk and vanilla.
1. Turn the speed down to low then gradually beat in flour and salt then add mini chocolate chips. A dough will form, but if it seems too crumbly, you may need to beat another 30-60 seconds on low for it to come together.
1. Remove the dough from the bowl and divide into two pieces. Place each piece between two sheets of plastic wrap. Roll each dough flat until 1/4-inch thick. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or until firm.
1. Working with one dough piece at a time, remove the top plastic wrap then cut into desired shapes. As you run out of dough, gather up the scraps and reroll. If the dough gets too warm and sticky, refrigerate until cold again.
1. Repeat with the second dough piece. Place shapes on 2 ungreased cookie sheets.
1. Preheat oven to 350F/177C. Refrigerate shapes on the cookie sheets while the oven preheats (roughly 15-20 minutes). You want everything to be cold to minimize spreading.
1. Bake cookies 9-11 minutes or until golden brown on the edges. Let sit for 5 minutes then carefully transfer to wire racks to cool completely.
1. Decorate with buttercream frosting and chocolate glaze (see below), if desired.
