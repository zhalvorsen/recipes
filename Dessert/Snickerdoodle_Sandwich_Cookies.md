- 1/2 teaspoon Cream of Tartar
- 1/2 teaspoon Baking Soda
- 1/2 teaspoon Cinnamon
- Sea Salt Caramel Syrup

### Cream Cheese Frosting

- 1/4 cup Butter Softened
- 8 ounces Cream Cheese Softened
- 4 cups Powdered Sugar
- 1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract
- 1-3 tablespoons Milk

## Directions

### Cookies

1. Preheat Oven to 375 Degrees
1. Line baking sheet with parchment paper or spray with cooking spray
1. In a mixing bowl beat butter on medium to high speed for 2 minutes and add 2 cups Sugar and continue to whip for 2 more minutes
1. Add eggs and vanilla extract and cream until combined and mixture is light and fluffy
1. In a separate bowl combine dry ingredients of All Purpose Flour, Cream of Tartar and Baking Soda. Mix to combine.
1. Add half flour mixture to butter mixture and mix together. When fully combined add remaining flour mixture.
1. Using a Medium size #24 cookie scoop shape into cookie dough balls.
1. In a separate bowl combine ½ teaspoon Cinnamon and ½ cup Sugar together. Roll cookie dough balls into mixture and fully coat.
1. Place cookie dough balls on baking sheet allowing 2 inches between cookies for baking
1. Bake at 375 Degrees for 9-11 minutes. Each oven cooks a little differently. Cookies are done with edges are just slightly golden. Do not over bake.
1. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for a couple minutes before moving to cooling racks.

### Cream Cheese Frosting

1. In a large bowl or stand mixer combine cream cheese and butter and mix together. Scrape sides of bowl as needed.
1. Add powdered sugar and mix. Frosting will be very thick.
1. Add vanilla extract and combine. Slowly the frosting will thin down a little bit.
1. Add milk a little at a time. I use about 1 tablespoon milk for a perfect thick cheesecake like filling.
1. Using a piping bag or a ziploc bag snip corner off of bag and pipe frosting onto cookie. Make a swirl around the outside of the cookie leaving the center with some holes
1. Fill holes with Sea Salt Caramel Syrup and drizzle on frosting. Place cookie on top to make a sandwich
1. Store cookies in refrigerator until ready to serve
