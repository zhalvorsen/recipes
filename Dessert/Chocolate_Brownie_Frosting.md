## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- pinch of salt
- 1 tbsp corn syrup
- 10 oz milk chocolate, chopped
- 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
- 8 tbsp cold unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces

1. Heat the cream, salt, and corn syrup in a microwave-safe measuring cup on high until simmering, about 1 minute, or bring to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat.
2. Place the chocolate in a food processor. With the machine running, gradually add the hot cream mixture through the feed tube; process 1 minute after the cream has been added. Stop the machine; add the confectioners' sugar and process to combine, about 30 seconds. With the machine running, add the butter through the feed tube 1 piece at a time; process until incorporated and smooth, about 20 seconds longer.
3. Transfer the frosting to a medium bowl and cool to room temperature, stirring frequently, until thick and spreadable, about 1 hour.

1. For dark chocolate frosting use 10 oz of semi-sweet chocolate
