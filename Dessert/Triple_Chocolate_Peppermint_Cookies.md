## Ingredients

- 3/4 cup butter softened
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract
- 1 3/4 cups flour
- 1/2 cup baking cocoa
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup white baking chocolate
- 1 cup semisweet baking chocolate
- 1/4 cup candy canes crushed

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a medium-sized mixing bowl cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and peppermint extract and mix until incorporated.
2. In another mixing bowl whisk the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt. Slowly add to the creamed mixture.
3. Shape dough into 1 inch balls and place 2 in. apart on un-greased baking sheets. Flatten to 2 in. rounds with the bottom of a glass. Bake 6-8 minutes or until set (do not overbake). Let cool completely on pans and transfer to a wire rack.
