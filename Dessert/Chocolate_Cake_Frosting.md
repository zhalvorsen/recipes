## Ingredients

- 3 oz unsweetened chocolate, coarsely chopped
- 6 oz bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped
- 1 cup unsalted butter
- 2 cup confectioners' sugar
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract

## Directions

1. Put both chocolates in a medium stainless steel bowl and place the bowl over a pot of barely simmering water. Heat, stirring frequently, until the chocolate is completely melted. Remove the bowl from the pot and set the chocolate aside to cool until tepid.
2. In the bowl of an electric mixer, using the paddle attachment, beat the butter at medium speed until creamy, about 30 seconds. Gradually add the confectioners' sugar and beat at high speed until light and creamy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the vanilla extract. Add the cooled chocolate at low speed, mixing until blended and scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Increase the speed to high and beat until slightly aerated, about 1 minute.

## Notes

1. Can substitute 9 tbsp of cocoa powder and 3 tbsp of butter for the 3 oz of unsweetened chocolate
